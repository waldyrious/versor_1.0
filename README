Disclaimer: this is currently a bit of hack to install and the library is not versioned correctly.


This is the very first Versor .00001 library.  It creates and embeds a cga (conformal geometric algebra) framework for calculating multivectors efficiently.  libvsr is the static wrapper around it.  


TO "INSTALL" ON MAC OSX:

Make files are not quite finished, so you'll need to use the built in xcode project, and run "TestVsrGlv.app".
