This is the Versor .00002 library.  Use it to draw geometrical things! Support for MAC OS X.  
Designed to run on other platforms but not currently supported.

The Xcode project in OSX/vsr/ takes care of the multistage compilation process

It creates and embeds a cga (conformal geometric algebra) framework for calculating multivectors.  
It creates libvsr.a, a library that calls the functions in the cga framework and does other nifty things
(like helps with common operations).  Take a look at Op.h.

Copyright UC Regents:

Whatever the typical GPL UC open source copyright says.  Free to re-distribute as long as this notice
is included, etc. 

External Librarys:
libvsr.a is a graphics library and so requires OpenGL.    

GLV is bundled and TestVsrGLV is an implementation that fuses vsr's interface class with a glv implementation.  
Made by my colleagues at MAT program at UCSB, GLV is good for quick and easy OpenGL guis.


TO "INSTALL" ON MAC OSX:
The cross-platform Make files are not finished, so you'll need to use the built in xcode project, and run "TestVsrGlv.app".
