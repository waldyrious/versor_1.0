Disclaimer: this is currently a bit of hack to install and the library is not versioned correctly.


This is the very first Versor .00001 library.  It loads a dynamic library for calculating multivectors efficiently.  libconga.dylib is the dynamic library.  libvsr is the static wrapper around it.  


TO "INSTALL" ON MAC OSX:

Drag and drop /lib/libconga.dylib to usr/local/lib
Try running the xcode project

Take a look at Op.h to see some of the built in functionality.

And er . . . good luck.  This will be updated soon!
