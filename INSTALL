Bindings exist to two cross-platform windowing systems, GLV (mat.ucsb.edu/glv/) and AlloCore, both made by my colleagues in the MAT program.
The easiest way to get started to is to use GLV.


TO BUILD ON MAC OSX or LINUX: 

	make vsr

This builds the static library.

You can also build the older version in the Dynamic folder (which, for now has more features, but only runs on mac os and is no longer supported.  It runs slower and you'll need to use the built in xcode project, and run "TestVsrGlv.app")
	The Xcode project in OSX/vsr/ takes care of the multistage compilation process.
	It creates and embeds a cga (conformal geometric algebra) framework for calculating multivectors into libvsr.a, a library that calls the functions in the cga framework and does other nifty things
	(like helps with draw routines and helps with common operations).  Take a look at Op.h.

DEPENDENCIES
---
libvsr.a can built in isolation with no dependencies except the standard library.  To use the draw routines, however, requires OpenGL, Glu, Glut, and GLEW (you likely already have these).  
To use the built-in interface, gui, mouse and keyboard, etc, requires GLV (Graphic Library of Views, Made by my colleagues at MAT program at UCSB) GLV is great for quick and easy OpenGL based 
interfaces.  Grab it here: 

	git clone git@github.com:AlloSphere-Research-Group/GLV.git


DOWNLOAD

For best results, cd into a common directory for all your code repositories -- 
For instance, assuming you have a directory called code with all your git repos . . . 

cd code
git clone git://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/GLV.git
git clone git://github.com/wolftype/vsr.git

BUILD

Typically you should be able to just type: 

make test

And the makefile will do the rest.

for a list of make options:
make help


UNIX / OSX:

Linux (Ubuntu)

Make sure you have glut and glew installed:

A) install glut*:
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev


*note on newer versions of ubuntu (11.10 and greater) you may also have to do:
sudo apt-get install binutils-gold

B) install glew:

1. on ubuntu, first do:
sudo apt-get install libxmu-dev libxi-dev

2. download tar or zip from http://glew.sourceforge.net/ 
cd into glew and type
sudo make install

or clone from current repos

git clone git://glew.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/glew/glew
cd glew
make extensions
sudo make install
