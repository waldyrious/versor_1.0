Some "Lacunae" (my friend Phil Popp uses this term to identify code to flesh out / features to add / etc)

1 - roll own gluProject and gluUnproject manual

2 - LUA handle for reading and writing scripts, saving settings, etc

3 - Pln_Pln is a simpler Motor (rotation around a line without a quadvector)  -- use it

4 - Lin_Flp is a "Reflection Glide"

5 - Pnt_Flp is a "Reflection in a Sphere Glide" 

5 - Par_Flp is a "Reflection in a Circle Glide" 


[in general consider combining reflection operators with rotor operations ]
