These are the lua files I use to generate Versor's list of operations.

Many of these files are in experimental stages.  For now, if you are interested
in learning more, your best bet is to contact me directly [ wolftype at gmail ]

basis - list of basis and order
func - products (returns "instructions" and id)

build - build types (with basis and funcs) generates types.lua

types - list of all types (see also org)

gen - build library
genlite -- static templates
gentest0

statics - static functions of template types
vsrheaders - build mk types, and statics

unroll - tests

grammar - parsing
bit - generic ga generating
